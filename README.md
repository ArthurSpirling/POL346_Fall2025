# POL 346 Applied Quantitative Analysis (Fall 2025)

In Fall 2025, I taught POL346 *[Applied Quantitative Analysis](https://registrar.princeton.edu/course-offerings/course-details?term=1262&courseid=005329)*.  I designed the course to build on POL345 "[Introduction to Quantitative Social Science](https://registrar.princeton.edu/course-offerings/course-details?term=1262&courseid=013781)".
With that in mind, it starts out by reiterating some material from POL345, albeit using some different approaches.  It then moves on to other topics such as 

- prediction (simple machine learning)
- causal inference from regression
- quasi-experiments
- logistic regression
- panel data
- text as data
- ethics

My goal was particularly to help students writing quantitative junior papers and senior theses. 

The following materials may of interest to other instructors: 

- Syllabus: so you can see what I taught week to week
- Book346: these are my course notes, and constitute a "textbook" of sorts for the course.
- Labs: these follow the lectures and course notes closely, and use R.


I hope these materials are helpful, please drop me a line if I can be further assistance.
